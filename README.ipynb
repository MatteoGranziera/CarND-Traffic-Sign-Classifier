    "The first architecture was the LeNet but was not enough to get more than 0.89 accuracy.\n",
    "I tried to use the YUV color space as in this [paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). But with my actual architecture was still under 0.85~0.87 of accuracy. By adding another convolutional layer the accuracy increase. After that I added a dropout to make the recognition more flexible. The accuracy rise the 0.93 accuracy araound the 20th ephoc but i decided leave 30 to consolidate the pattern.\n",
